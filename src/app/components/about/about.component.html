<p>Hey what's up. My name is Jase. I'm an artist, chemist & full-stack developer based out of New Jersey.
I enjoy design driven development - turning beautiful pixels into elegant code. When I'm not writing,
listening to hip-hop or face palming from missed brackets, you can usually catch me on my PS4. Let's collab on some dope sh*t.<p>
